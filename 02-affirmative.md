# Format: Affirmative Feedback

“What worked?” Il n’y a pas de “MAIS”! Structure de phrase: “this worked for me”...

Selon K. Benammar :

> Feedback is usually associated with criticism, but we also want to learn from what works. This is different from giving a compliment. The aim is to communicate what worked for us. Start your Affirmative Feedback with “What worked for me is x”.
