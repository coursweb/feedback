# Format: Perspectives Feedback

"en tant que... j'ai besoin de ..."

Les critiques deviennent relatives et subjectives. La formule “what do I need” projette vers le futur, rend la critique constructive.

Selon K. Bennamar :

> What perspective are you asking your question from? Are you reacting as an audience member, as a peer, as a friend, as a journalist, as a fellow German? Make clear what your most important need is from this perspective. Start your Perspectives Feedback with “As x, I need y”.
