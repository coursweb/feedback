# Format:Gossip

Observations formulées à la troisième personne.

Selon K. Bennamar :

> Gossip is a group discussion; everyone can speak freely, as if the presenter was not there, in the third person. The presenter listens attentively without reacting. A gossip session allows views to be aired for which there is no space in the more regulated forms of feedback.
